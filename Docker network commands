Docker Networks defaults:

•	Each container connected to a private virtual network “bridge”
•	Each virtual network routes through NAT firewall on host IP
•	All containerts on a virtual network can talk to each other without -p
•	Best practice is to create a new virtual network for each app.
o	Network “my_web_app” for mysql and php/apache containers
o	Network “my_api” for mongo and nodejs containers

Docker networks: CLI management
•	Show networks: docker network ls
•	Inspect a network: docker network inspect
•	Create a network: docker network create –driver
•	Attach a network to container: docker network conncect
•	Detach a network from contaianer: docker network disconnect
