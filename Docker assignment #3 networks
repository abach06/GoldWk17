Assignment: DNS RR Test
•	Know how to use -it to get shell in container
•	Understand basics of what a linux distro is like: ubuntu and CentOS
•	Know how to run a container
•	Understand basics of DNS records
•	Ever since docker engine 1.11, we can have multiple containers on. A created network respond to the same DNS address.
•	Create a new virtual network (default bridge driver)
•	Create two containers from elasticsearch:2 image
•	Research and use -network-alias search when creating them to give them an additional DNS name to respond to 
•	Run alpine nslookup search with –net to see the two containers list for the same DNS name
•	Run centos curl -s search:9200 with –net multiple times until you see both “name” fields show

docker network create Aaron
docker container run -d --net Aaron --net-alias search elasticsearch:2

#Option 2: you can replace the image name with bretfisher/httpenv (which runs on port 8888, not 9200) and get the same effect in this assignment. It's just a simple web server that returns the environment variables (including the container name to tell them apart) in HTTP

docker container run --rm --net Aaron alpine nslookup search  
docker container run --rm --net Aaron centos curl -s search:9200
